## Overview
We addressed a combination of **Problem Statement 1** and **Problem Statement 2**, focusing on improving article publishing across various platforms. Our solution leverages the capabilities of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, including **LLaMA**, **Mistral**, and **Gemini**, to enhance the quality, relevance, and adaptability of content for diverse audiences and mediums.

To make the solution accessible and user-friendly, we developed an **interactive user interface** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This interface enables users to seamlessly interact with the system, customize content, and publish articles efficiently across multiple platforms.

By integrating these state-of-the-art LLMs with a robust front-end, our solution provides a scalable, efficient, and user-centric platform for content creators and publishers.

## Challenges Faced During Development

### 1. Model Downtime on Render
- While hosting the LLM models on Render, we encountered frequent **downtime issues**, impacting the reliability of our project during crucial stages.
- This required constant troubleshooting and testing to maintain system functionality.

### 2. Database Integration Issues with AstraDB
- Initially, we planned to integrate **AstraDB** for database management. However, due to technical complications and delays in setup, we faced significant hurdles in achieving seamless integration.
- After discussing alternatives with our mentor, we pivoted to **Firebase** at the last hour. This quick switch required rapid reconfiguration of database queries and adjustments to our workflow.
